## Challenge

After some pretty profound success on Etsy selling the Original Bungee Jumping Jesus, the owner of Obscure City, LLC wanted to get away from the crazy fees and search engine phillandry of Etsy.

## Key Features

Products from Obscure City are striking and impactful, yet simple in nature.
To me, this screams the style “[BRUTALISM](https://designlab.com/blog/examples-brutalism-in-web-design)” to not only represent the product faithfully but establish a fun, playful, and bold way to connect with their buyers.

### Personal Jesus
- Choose the color and style of the bungee cord 
- Optionally blacken your Jesus for extra sinfulness 
- Visually see your choices on Jesus in real time as you select them

### Hate Mail
- As expected, Obscure City, LLC gets a lot of hate mail, death threats, and just general lunacy from fundamentalists 
- The staff responds to these messages accordingly and the interactions often end up very humorous 
- Interactions have variety of styles to make them unique for the content and tone of the exchange 
- A form facilitates the gathering of further hate mail 

### Packing Slips
- Staff selects an order
- A printable, detailed invoice appears with a custom, funny generated “thank you” message
- Invoice is printed and tucked into the package
