## Challenge

A volunteer-run, non-profit theater company that puts on 3 full productions each year (not to mention fundraisers) doesn’t have a lot of time to dally in maintaining a website.
And for a theater company that’s been doing productions for more than 15 years, they had little to no archives available documenting the immense amount of high-quality material they have produced.

## Key Features

One of the board members is a fellow, talented UX Designer that had the responsibilities of “make website right and good” foisted upon them. This was in addition to all their other responsibilities, but it gave them a good leg up with a solid respect of what websites can and can’t do.

### Shows Archive
- Luckily the company had kept pretty great records and photos of all their past productions, despite missing an online archive
- Added capability of cast list, ticketing, alternate showtimes, and everything else a theater company would want to show about past and upcoming shows.
- Shows automatically archive themselves once the season is complete

### Style Tidy-Up
- The UX Designing board member had done a really great job of aligning a lot of styles and presentation of data
- There were slight disparities in font sizes, contrast, and some general ADA issues that required just a little nudge to get into the right position
- Entirely new WordPress site was built with their existing design ethos but made consistent across all pages and data delivery
- Mobile experience was completely revamped and simplified to make finding shows, tickets, and information so much easier for visitors

### Blog Experience
- One of the board members has time to input all the archive content as well as draft some of the press information
- This is a perfect use case for a Blog. A place to candidly talk about productions, cross reference other productions, and get a slew of new keywords directing at the productions themselves
- The volunteers have been beyond excellent at updating information and drafting blogs that have been helping to drive traffic to the site
