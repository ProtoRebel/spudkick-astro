## Challenge

Tattoo shops are commonly known for walls covered in random pieces of art, loud music playing, and people sitting around an open space getting tattooed.
IX of Pentacles offers a different experience focused on fine art and not being overstimulated.
You’re about to get an art piece permanently applied on your body by getting stabbed repeatedly at 5,000+ RPM, so a centered, non-over stimulating environment is key to executing their mission as a tattoo shop in Idaho’s Treasure valley.

## Key Features

The big goal of any artistic website is “show me the work and shut up.”
When in an oversaturated market, sometimes just a fancy gallery isn’t enough and you need to show why your shop is different.

### Tattoo + Fine Art Galleries
- Art is heavily featured throughout
- On general information pages, fine art  photos are randomized so the site has a constantly evolving feel
- When visiting individual artists, the photos are not randomized so photos can be easily referenced

### Mid Century Style & Function
- Being focused on fine art, an equally fine art style website is important and the overall aesthetic of the shop is art deco
- Alignment, shapes, and affectation is important to convey the art deco style on web
- The art deco movement began in the roaring 20’s when mechanical engineering became more enmeshed with art, giving us sleek hidden drawers and unexpected, impressive transitions with everyday items
Animation and movement mimics the mechanical engineering sleekness that emerged alongside art deco in the 1920’s
